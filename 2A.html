	      <p>I, well, my first thought is, with both statements is, because it’s almost, it’s almost the level is at, 
		      <b>it almost sounds like they’ve all got to be at exactly 58 but you mean 58 or below on both statements</b>, 
		      it kind of, it doesn’t say that but it kind of, it almost and of course there is, I mean I don’t know 
		      if this is relevant but there is a risk of then having to make it too low as well, [...] so the wording 
		      needs to be [...] level is 58 you don’t want it at, it’s that or below? </p> 
	      <p><b>so in my job I wouldn’t act on either </b>[...] erm, just the nature of my job because this looks like it is 
		      meant to be for a kind of practice, yes, at your practice</p>
	      <p>what I would want instantly is a comparator to how is that compared to everyone else, is that good or bad, 
		      if it’s good ok I probably wouldn’t bother reading the recommendation </p>
	      <p><b>the recommendations I don’t know how I would react to that but they look kind of it almost looks like 
		      sucking eggs doesn’t it.</b> Reveal your patient you know that is what my job is, that is what I do, or 
		      I don’t know I would get into, unless there was something I’d never thought of before and actually 
		      there is a case study or something that someone else has done that and they move from 75.5</p>
	      <p>what I don’t know is where some practice has done 90% what was the x factor that might be interesting 
		      because I am probably doing these things and probably almost going but I’m doing those things but and 
		      I would probably be thinking the next door one, yes probably 10% higher but that’s probably because 
		      they have just got a different mixture of patients you know, I am doing the best I can where as <b>if it 
		      was next door practice has got 80 something and he did x I get ahh that’s helpful, that is actually 
		      interesting </b> because this is, this looks like pretty much unless I haven’t read it properly you know, 
		      standard stuff. </p>
	      <p>I mean is pretty easy because it is so simple as in its almost <b>simple to 
		      the point of being dull</b>, [...] I mean I suppose it doesn’t catch your eye at all does it, it’s bland
